# Troubleshooting
If you have error:
```
Forbidden
You don't have permission to access /app/overview.py on this server. 
```

Check owner(must be apache, or another user for apache)

If at first login you have:
```
Internal Server Error
```

Do this:
```
$ cd /var/www/haproxy-wi/app
$ ./create_db.py
```
and check executeble py files

If you see plain text, check section "Directory" in httpd conf
